give me code for a system that is for a gps tracking and fuel management application that has the following features and is built on top of traccar:

-The proposed solution should provide for real-time vehicle tracking using GPS and GSM technology.
-The system should provide for the historical playback feature to view past routes. An authorized user should be able to select the vehicle and the period for which the play back is required.
-The system should have the capability to enforce geofencing capabilities allowing for the creation of virtual boundaries, triggering alerts if these are breached.
-The proposed solution should support multiple map views, including but not limited to satellite, hybrid, and where possible street view
-The proposed system must have the capability to monitor fuel consumption with detailed logs for each vehicle in real time.
-The proposed system must have the capability to monitor fuel consumption with detailed logs for each vehicle in real time.
-The proposed system must have the capability to monitor fuel consumption with detailed logs for each vehicle in real time.
-The system should provide for fuel efficiency reports and analytics with the capability for defined users to define individual reports based on their needs
-The proposed solution must provide for APIs to enable integration with other solutions for example smart gates, fuel card systems, ERP system for staff data among others.
-The proposed solution must have the capability to measure the amount of fuel dispensed into the vehicle at each time of re-fueling with a 99% level of accuracy.
-The proposed solution must provide for a mechanism to monitor the fuel usage during the operation of the motor vehicle and the Fuel data must register accuracy level of not less than 99%
-The proposed system should be able to perform predictive maintenance using vehicle diagnostics and data held on the system.
-The system should provide for alerts and reminders for periodic checks like oil change, tire rotations, etc.
-The proposed system must have a functionality to keep track and store maintenance history for each vehicle. 
The proposed as part of the maintenance, should provide for integration with parts inventory to monitor stock levels and reordering.
-driver behaviour monitoring feature:  the system should Monitor metrics like speed, idle time, harsh acceleration, and sudden braking.
-Scorecards for Driver behavior to identify and train high-risk Drivers.
-Fatigue and distraction alerts based on driving patterns.
-The proposed system must provide for role-based access control with customizable permissions per user role.
-user management Audit trails to monitor system access and changes
-Multi-factor authentication for enhanced security
-API integrations for Data exchange with BI systems
-Pre-built templates for common fleet reports.
-Customizable dashboard with widgets for a tailored view.
-Exportable reports in multiple formats like PDF, Excel
-API integrations with enterprise systems like HR, Finance, and Inventory.
-Support for third-party plugins and extensions
-Seamless integration with IoT devices.
-The proposed solution should provide a document management system for licenses, insurance, and other vital document
-The proposed solution should provide alerts to an authorized user with regards to license renewals and expiries.
